# acoustofluidic-control

This repository contains code for TUNI acoustofluidic manipulation
setup. The setup is documented in the following paper:

Kyriacos Yiannacou and Veikko Sariola, "Controlled Manipulation and
Active Sorting of Particles Inside Microfluidic Chips Using Bulk
Acoustic Waves and Machine Learning", Langmuir, 37 (14), 4192â€“4199,
2021.

The code was written and tested in Matlab 2019a&b and Matlab 2021a.

Probably the most interesting part of the repository is the script
[src/bandit_ctrl.m](src/bandit_ctrl.m), which contains the
implementation of our e-greedy and UCB1 control algorithms, and
[src/sfb_ctrl.m](src/sfb_ctrl.m), which contains the script for sparse
regression control algorithm.

Also [src/+experiments/](src/+experiments/) is of interest, as it
contains basic scripts to run the single-particle, multi-particle
manipulation experiments, scripts to learn the sparse regression
controller, and a script to write the university logo.

## How to run tests

To test the code, run `runtests tests`.
